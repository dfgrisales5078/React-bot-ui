## JavaScript/React simple website.
Plain website that is meant to be used along with the Get Instagram Likes API endpoint (Repository linked below). 

Currently, API is not deployed and therefore must be ran locally in order for it to interact with the POST request sent by the Website (https://main.d1s1ozkoy4xkk0.amplifyapp.com/), which is currently deployed using AWS Amplify.

The payload sent by the POST method form sends the following information to the API endpoint: username (instagram account to interact with), posts (number of posts to like on the account), and follow (determines is account should be followed as well.)
